<P>
The document is a user guide for the Gear and Tire Applet.  The first section
describes general use of the applet and the other sections contain more specific
information about
<A HREF="tire.html">tires</A>,
<A HREF="trans.html">transmissions</A>,
<A HREF="xfer.html">transfer cases</A>, and
<A HREF="rnp.html">ring and pinion</A>,
The general section covers what the Gear and Tire Applet is and what it can be
used for.  It also covers general information on ratios and the input and output
of the Gear and Tire Applet.


<H2>What is the Gear and Tire Applet?</H2>
<P>
The gear and tire form is designed to assist you making gear and tire selections
for your four wheel drive vehicle.  Larger tires gain ground clearance, increase
maximum fording depth, and increase the angles of departure and approach, but
they often don't work well with OEM gearing.  Auto manufactures build trucks
for the street, which means they select high gearing for fast acceleration
and better gas milage.  When larger tires are put on these trucks, the driver
may find themselves burning through clutches because first gear is so high.
Engine performance and gas milage may suffer because the engine is forced to
work outside of it's optimal RPM ranges.  Top speed on the highway will
increase, but so will low speed on the trail.
<P>
There are two main motivations to regear, the first is to return the truck to
the manufactures operating ranges to improve engine performance and decrease
wear and tear on the clutch and transmission.  The second is to increase
offroad performance with lower gearing.  Lower gearing allows the offroader
to go slower through obstacles giving the driver better control so there is
less chance of vehicle damage and occupant injury.  There is a penalty for
low gears on top highway cruising speed.  The gear and tire form is designed
to allow the user to try different configurations and see what performance
will be like for different configurations before going through an expensive
gear swap.


<H2>General Information on Gear Ratios</H2>
<P>
One important aspect of gear ratios is numerically large gears are the low
ones.  Gear ratios are normally stated in the form x.xx:1, e.g. 6.32:1.  This
translates mathematically to 1/6.32, and since 1/2 is more than 1/6, 6:1 is
lower than 2:1.  The ratio means that for every 6.32 revolutions from the
input the output will rotate once.  This happens to be granny low first gear
on a Ford T-18 transmission.  When you are in first with the T-18, the engine
does 6.32 revolutions for every 1 revolution the transmissions outputs.
Fourth gear on the T-18 is 1.00:1, so for every revolution of the engine, it
outputs one revolution.


<H2>Input for the Gear and Tire Applet</H2>
<P>
The Gear and Tire Applet takes as input your tire size, transmission ratios,
transfer case low range, and ring and pinion.
<P>
The tire field will accept input in English or metric sizes.  The entire
metric size must be input to calculate diameter, but the prefix 'P' or 'LT'
are optional.  For example the tire size P225/75R15 could be entered without
the 'P'.  For English sizes, the gear and tire form is only interested in
the diameter in inches.  The rest is not needed, but if it is typed it will
be ignored.  For example '32x11.50R15LT M+S' can be just entered 32.
<P>
Input of Transmission ratios, transfer case low range, and ring and pinion
all have the same basic form.  The Gear and Tire Applet is looking for the
ratios and ratios are commonly expressed in the form x.xx:1.  To save some
typing the ':1' part does not need to be entered.  You can enter it if you
like but, it will be ignored.  If you have tooth counts, for ring and pinion
for example, just divide the big number by the small.  For example 41/10
ring and pinion translate to 4.10:1.
<P>
The user has the option to produce output in kilometers per hour or miles
per hour.  No output is produced until the 'calculate' button is pressed.
This document is available by pressing the 'help' button.


<H2>Output for the Gear and Tire Applet</H2>
<P>
When the calculate button is pressed
output is created in both graphical and tabular form.  The graph is a line
graph with RPM on the x-axis ranging from 0 to 4000 RPM.  The y-axis is either
MPH or KPH depending on user input.  MPH range from 0 to 80 MPH.  KPH range
from 0 to 120 KPH.  Each transmission gear is printed out as a seperate
line in the graph first being red, second blue, third green, fourth black,
and fifth yellow.  A check box at the botton of the graph allows the user
to "shift" the transfer case into low range.  The title of the graph gives
the users tire size and ring and pinion ratio.
<P>
The tabular output is also produced each time the calculate button is
pressed.  The title on the tabular output indicates the units of output
either KPH or MPH.  It also indicates the users selection of tire and
ring and pinion and allows the user to enter different RPMs to see the
table at various engine outputs.  Each row of the table represents a
gear of the transmission first, second, third and so forth.  The columns
represent high and low range of the transfer case.
<P>
The crawl ratio, which is often used to compare gearing set ups,
is also included in the tabular output.  The crawl ratio represents
compound low, or first gear of the transmission and low range of the
transfer case.  For example, many Wranglers have a first gear around
3.83:1, the transfer case low range is 2.72:1, and the axle ring and
pinion is 3.07:1.  This means the crawl ratio is 3.83*2.72*3.07 or around
32:1.  Put some big tires on that Wrangler and it will be difficult to
control on a technical trail.  A crawl ratio around 60:1 is often good
target.

<H1>Tires</H1>
As mentioned in the overview the tire input field will accept input
in English or metric sizes.  The entire metric size must be input to
calculate diameter, but English sizes only require the diameter in
inches to be entered.  Sorry, the Gear and Tire Applet does not
support old tire sizing conventions such has H78 etc.  If you actually
have tires this old, you'll have to break out the tape measure and
input the diameter in inches.
<P>
This section covers the method metric tires are translated to inches
and how tire size changes speed.


<H2>How to Convert Metric Tire Sizes</H2>
<P>
Metric tire sizes are made up of four components: prefix, width, aspect
ratio, and wheel size.  It takes three of these components to calculate
the diameter of the tire.  It sure is not a very straight forward sizing
convention.
<P>
The prefix is used to indicate general use of the tire.  The
tire input field trys to ignore the prefix and if your prefix causes an
error, just don't input it.  The Gear and Tire Applet currently will
successfully ignore 'P' for passenger car and 'LT' for light truck.  When
in doubt, drop the prefix.
<P>
The width simply the width of the tire in mm.  For example the tire size
P215/75R15 has a width of 215mm.
<P>
The next component is the aspect ratio.  The aspect ratio is the percentage
of the width that makes up the sidewall of the tire.  In the above example
the aspect ratio is 75 or 75%, so the sidewall height is 75% of 215 or
161.25mm.  If you want the diameter of the tire, you need to take into
acount that the diameter of the tire passes two sections of the side wall.
This means the sidewall takes up 161.25*2 or 322.5mm of the diameter.
<P>
The next component is the wheel size.  In the above example the wheel size
is 15".  If you convert the total sidewall into inches you get
322.5mm*0.03937in/mm or about 12.7".  Add that to wheel size and you get the
diameter 15"+12.7" is 27.7".  So a P215/75R15 tire has a diameter of about
27.7".


<H2>How Tire Sizes Effects Speed</H2>
The formula for circumfrence of a circle is used to calculate how tire sizes
effect speed.  To calculate the circumfrence of a circle the Gear and Tire
Applet uses the classic formula 2(pi)r, or given the diameter it is simply
the diameter times pi.  This means in the above example a 27.7" tire has
a circumfrence of 27.7(pi) or around 87".  Every time the tire rotates once,
the vehicle travels 87".  This can be converted to miles or kilometers for
calculations of speed given the number of engine revolutions per hour.
Anyway looking at the simple formulat d(pi) it is clear that a larger tire
travels further for each revolutions since it has a bigger circumfrence.
That is why when larger tires are swapped in, you go faster.

<H1>Transmissions</H1>
The Gear and Tire Applet allows you to enter up to 5 speeds and a reverse
gear ratio.  If you have a 3 speed or don't have the reverse ratio, there
is no need to input the extra information.  If you aren't sure what
transmission you have you can use the generalizations here to get numbers
that probably will be very accurate give or take a few KPH/MPH.


<H2>Generalizations About Manual Transmissions</H2>
Ratios for manual transmissions don't vary all that much.  Most of the
time first gear is around 4:1 unless it granny low truck transmission such
as the T-18, NP435, SM465, SM420 etc.  These transmissions have a first
anywhere between 6.32:1 to 7.20:1.  Generally, the final drive gear
is straight through or 1.00:1 coupling the input shaft directly to the
main shaft.  I've never seen a 3 or 4 speed that didn't have a 1.00:1
final drive gear.  Five speed transmissions have a 1.00:1 fourth and an
overdrive.  The overdrive fifth gear is typically around 0.75:1.  So,
when in doubt, use 4.00:1, 3.00:1, 2.00:1, 1.00:1 for a 4 speed.


<H2>Generalizations About Automatic Transmissions</H2>
The author of this document is not particularly knowledgable about automatic
transmissions, but he is still willing to make some generalizations.  Most
automatics seem to have a first gear around 3:1 and final drive gear of 1:1.
Overdrive automatics tend to have 0.75:1 overdrive.

<H1>Tranfer Case</H1>
It wouldn't be four wheel drive without a transfer case.  The transfer
case transfers power from the transmission to the rear and front axles.
Typically, the driver has 2 high, 4 high, neutral, and 4 low.  The Gear
and Tire Applet supports the standard two speed transfer cases.  If you
have a three speed transfer case, you'll have to enter the ratios
separately.
<P>
High range is assumed to be 1:00:1 for 2 high and 4 high.  Low range is
input by the user.  Low range is typically around 2.50:1.

<H1>Ring and Pinion</H1>
The ring and pinion are located in the differential housing of the axle.
The pinion takes input from the driveshaft and turns the ring.  The ring
spins the differential which turns the axle shafts.  There are
a fairly wide variety of ring and pinions ratios available anywhere from
2.73:1 to 6.50:1 depending on the model of the axle.  Since transmission
and transfercase ratios are fairly set, a change of ring and pinion is
the easiest and least expensive way to modify the gearing of your 4x4.
<P>
Figuring out what ratio ring and pinion you have is not always easy.
Depending on engine, transmission, and option package the manufacturer
may have used any one of several ratios.  The easiest way is to locate
and try to read the tag on on the differential housing.  Sometimes
this tag is located on the differential housing cover, sometimes it is
not.  It may be a a code stamped in the housing that needs to be looked
up in your technical service manual.
<P>
One sure fire way of determining your ratio is openning up the axle and
taking a look.  Often the ring is stamped with tooth count, ratio, and
build date.  Sometimes it isn't stamped, but you can still count the
teeth yourself and divide ring teeth by pinion teeth to get the ratio.
<P>
An easier, but not as accurate method of determining your ratio
is to jack one wheel off the ground and count the number of drive shaft
rotations it takes to turn the tire one full rotation.  Multiply this
number by two and that is your ratio.  If you have a looking or limited
slip differential, you may find it difficult to rotate the tire by hand.
If this is the case lift both tires off the ground and support the vehicle
with jack stands to count rotations for one rotation of both tires.
<P>
One final note on ring and pinion, if you know the ratio of one axle the
other should be the same give or take a few hundredths.  So if you find
a tag on the front, but nothing on the rear, go with the tag you found.
